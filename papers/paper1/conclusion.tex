\section{Conclusion and Future Work\label{conclusion}}

\begin{itemize}
  \item We are going to use it to build the substrate.
  \item Speculate on moving down into operating system (device drivers would be easy, IPC including filesystem replaced by automata)
  \item Speculate on moving down into the hardware level (Local talent, Ivan Sutherland)
  \item We can take advantage of multi-core in a very straight-forward way
  \item New problems in scheduling (Pinning automata to processors to minimize actions that span two processors.  Maximum independent set.)
  \item We are non-blocking all the way.  Combine this with a deterministic implementation of the scheduler and model and there are serious opportunities for real-time.
\end{itemize}
