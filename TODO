Split the execution interface of the model based on valued/unvalued.
I don't remember why I was thinking about this but it might reduce code bloat.
I remember one reason.
Binding requires a dynamic cast to an output executor of the appropriate type.
This might obviate the need to a dynamic cast.

Move all mutex and thread related stuff to lib.
mutex.hpp
shared_mutex.hpp
