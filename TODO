Evaluate schedule_after.
Should we provide a mechanism for cancelling?
Should a subsequent schedule replace or add to an existing one?
Should a schedule at an earlier time replace a later one?

Split the execution interface of the model based on valued/unvalued.
I don't remember why I was thinking about this but it might reduce code bloat.
