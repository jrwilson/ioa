<h3 class="section">1.2 Implementation Considerations</h3>

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.1 Dynamics</h4>

<p>The I/O automata model assumes that the automata in a system are <em>static</em>. 
By static I mean that all automata exist in their initial states and before the first action is executed. 
This also means that outputs and inputs that are composed can be consolidated and treated as one action.

   <p>Real systems, on the other hand, are <em>dynamic</em>. 
Consider an operating system where processes are created, run, and then possibly exit. 
Processes can interact with one another but the exact nature of the interaction is dependent on time since the set of existing processes in dependent on time. 
For I/O automata, this means that we require the ability to create new automata, destroy existing automata, and change which outputs and inputs are composed. 
We use the term <dfn>binding</dfn> to refer to the act of dynamically associating an output with an input. 
We use the term <dfn>configuration</dfn> to refer to the actions of creating and destroying automata and binding and unbinding external actions.

<h4 class="subsection">1.2.2 Scheduling</h4>

<p>The only requirement that the I/O automata model places on the scheduler is fairness. 
This is intentional as it reduces the number of assumptions that one needs to make about the environment. 
The scheduler is assumed to be omniscient, i.e., it knows all of the actions and can find an action with a true precondition. 
While implementing an omniscient scheduler is possible, it hinders the development of an efficient scheduler, i.e., one that avoids selecting actions whose precondition are false. 
Consequently, the decision was made that the user is responsible for telling the scheduler which actions to consider. 
The scheduler can implement different scheduling policies that influence the order in which actions are selected. 
Again, the only requirement is that the scheduler is fair.

   <p>The act of telling the scheduler to consider an action for selection and execution is called <dfn>scheduling</dfn>. 
If a user decides to schedule all actions all the time, then the scheduler degenerates into a brute-force omniscient scheduler. 
A better approach has the user test the precondition of all actions and schedules those that are true. 
The best approach has the user perform a dependency analysis to determine which actions could possibly enable other actions and then schedule the enabled actions. 
Notice that this optimization is not possible unless users schedule the actions. 
All of the examples in this document use the middle approach.
